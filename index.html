        <h3>Security researcher Ryan Cannon recently developed a technique that allows a screen lock bypass by installing an
            app through the new web-based Android Market (Cannon, T., n.d.). Ryan's technique utilizes a new feature in the
            web-based Android Market that allows apps to be installed directly from the web site. As such, you must have
            access to the Android Market using the primary Gmail user name and password for the device, which may be
            accessible from the primary computer of the user. Alternatively, you could access the Android Market if you knew
            the user name and password and had sufficient authority. Changing the user's Gmail password would not work in
            this instance. Ryan was ill lately so he created a backup and stored the zip file on this server for his team
            mate to access it. Now his teammate Alex is not able to get access to that zip file. Help Alex to find the
            backup file on the server.
